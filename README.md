# WaferFaultDetection
A wafer is a piece of silicon or other semiconductor material, designed in the form of a very thin disc. Wafers are used to create electronic integrated circuits (ICs) and silicon-based photovoltaic cells. These wafers provide a large volume of data as an output through sensors. Based on the reading provided the sensors and using classification ML algorithms I have predict if the wafer is faulty or not. Using this ML app the companies can save a huge amount of man power, time as well as money.
